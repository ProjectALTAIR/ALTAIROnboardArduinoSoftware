# ALTAIROnboardArduinoSoftware
Software running onboard the Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3 and the Arduino Micro in flight, within the balloon payload; and also the software on the Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3 within each ground station.  Most of the actual code is within C++ classes within the "libraries" subdirectory (just as it should be! \<shakes finger...\>).
