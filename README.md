# ALTAIROnboardArduinoSoftware
Software running onboard the Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3 and the Arduino Micro in flight, within the balloon payload; and also the software on the Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3 within each ground station.  Most of the actual code is within C++ classes within the <a href="https://github.com/ProjectALTAIR/ALTAIROnboardArduinoSoftware/tree/master/libraries"> "libraries" subdirectory</a> (just as it should be! \<shakes finger...\> :) .

On windows, one might have to install the following libraries via the Arduino IDE library manager: RadioHed, SdFat, TinyGPSPlus.
